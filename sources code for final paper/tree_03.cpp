/* 
Knuth's power tree is a data structure that allows for efficient exponentiation by representing the exponentiation operation as a tree. Each node in the tree represents a multiplication operation, and the leaves represent the base. The tree is constructed such that the height of the tree is logarithmic in the exponent, which allows for efficient exponentiation.

Here is an example of how you could implement Knuth's power tree in C++:
 */
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct Node {
    long long x;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node(long long x) : x(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

Node* constructPowerTree(long long x, long long n) {
    if (n == 1) {
        return new Node(x);
    }
    Node* left = constructPowerTree(x, n / 2);
    Node* right = constructPowerTree(x, n - n / 2);
    Node* root = new Node(left->x * right->x);
    root->left = left;
    root->right = right;
    return root;
}

long long computePower(Node* root) {
    if (root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL) {
        return root->x;
    }
    long long left = computePower(root->left);
    long long right = computePower(root->right);
    return left * right;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage of constructPowerTree and computePower functions
    long long x = 2;
    long long n = 10;
    Node* root = constructPowerTree(x, n);
    cout << x << "^" << n << " = " << computePower(root) << endl;
    return 0;
}
/* 
This code defines a Node struct that represents a node in the power tree, with a value x and pointers to its left and right children. It also defines two functions: constructPowerTree and computePower.

The constructPowerTree function takes in two long long integers x and n and returns a pointer to the root node of the power tree that represents the exponentiation x^n. It uses a recursive approach to construct the tree, with the base case being when n is 1, in which case it simply returns a new leaf node with value x. If n is greater than 1, it calculates the left and right subtrees by calling itself recursively with n = n/2 and n = n - n/2 respectively, and then creates a new node with value x = left->x * right->x and sets its left and right children to the left and right subtrees respectively.

The computePower function takes in a pointer to the root node of a power tree and returns the result of the exponentiation represented by the tree. It uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree, with the base case being when the node has no children (i.e. it is a leaf), in which case it simply returns its value. If the node has children, it calculates the values of its left and right children by calling itself recursively and then returns their product.

This implementation of Knuth's power tree has a time complexity of O(log n), which means that it scales efficiently
