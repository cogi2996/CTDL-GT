Yes, it is possible to use a tree data structure to perform exponentiation efficiently without using recursion. One such method is the "exponentiation by squaring" algorithm, which involves constructing a binary tree representation of the exponentiation operation and then using a bottom-up approach to compute the result.

Here is an example of how you could implement the exponentiation by squaring algorithm in C++ without using recursion:
 */
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

struct Node {
    long long x;
    long long n;
    Node(long long x, long long n) : x(x), n(n) {}
};

long long exponentiate(long long x, long long n) {
    stack<Node> s;
    s.emplace(x, n);
    long long result = 1;
    while (!s.empty()) {
        Node top = s.top();
        s.pop();
        if (top.n == 0) {
            continue;
        }
        if (top.n == 1) {
            result = result * top.x;
            continue;
        }
        if (top.n % 2 == 0) {
            s.emplace(top.x, top.n / 2);
            s.emplace(top.x, top.n / 2);
        } else {
            s.emplace(top.x, (top.n - 1) / 2);
            s.emplace(top.x, (top.n - 1) / 2);
            s.emplace(top.x, 1);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage of exponentiate function
    long long x = 2;
    long long n = 13;
    cout << x << "^" << n << " = " << exponentiate(x, n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
/* 
This version of the function uses a stack to store the nodes of the binary tree representation of the exponentiation operation. It pushes the root node onto the stack, and then enters a loop that continues until the stack is empty. Inside the loop, it pops the top node from the stack and processes it according to its value of n. If n is 0 or 1, it simply continues or multiplies result by x respectively. If n is even, it pushes two child nodes with n = n/2 onto the stack. If n is odd, it pushes two child nodes with n = (n - 1)/2 onto the stack, as well as one child node with n = 1.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), which means that it scales efficiently as the value of n increases. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
